Newest changes first. Each section header is the release date.

## v1.1.2 - 2026-05-27

### Clearer error when the bot can't see the game
If the bot starts and can't identify any FH6 menu screens (most often because the game language isn't English), the status now reads **"Set game language to English"** instead of the vague "could not recover".

### Better diagnostic logs
The full config is now logged at session start, and any setting changes made from the Settings tab get logged with old → new values. Useful when sharing `sniper.log` for troubleshooting.

## v1.1.1 - 2026-05-27

### Sold-listing detection fix
The bot was occasionally still trying to buy listings that had just sold - it would land on the View Seller / View Highest Bidder menu before backing out, wasting a cycle. Root cause: with moving background on, the bright FH6 menu scene showing through empty slots was being mistaken for a card. Detection now looks for the pure-white card UI body specifically, which the game's background scene never produces. The bot will correctly skip sold listings instead of stumbling into the wrong menu.

### Auto-fix for wrong Moving background flag
If your in-game **Moving background** setting doesn't match the **Moving background mode** toggle in the bot's Settings, the bot will now spot the mismatch on the first buyout attempt (about a second in), flip its own toggle to match, save the new value, and carry on. Costs one missed sale, then the bot runs as if the flag had been correct from the start.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-05-26

### Settings panel
New **Settings** tab in the overlay. Edit match sensitivity, loop speed, auto-stop limits, notifications, hotkeys, HDR mode, moving background, and overlay visibility in screenshots / recordings. Saves and applies live.

### Resolution & monitor support
- 1080p, 1440p, 4K: all work.
- Ultrawide / 16:10 / 4:3: run FH6 windowed at 1920×1080. Black bars get cropped automatically.

### HDR
HDR was shifting FH6's lime UI toward yellow and breaking color detection. Fixed. Extra **HDR mode** toggle in Settings for displays that shift even more.

### Slow-load fix
Was reporting "no cars" when the Auction House just hadn't finished loading yet. Now recognizes the loading screen and waits.

### Polish
- Tabbed Status / Settings layout
- Collapsible Settings sections, scrolls if your screen is short
- Faster captures at high resolutions

### Logs
Cleaner state names, including the new loading state.
